				<p class="wow fadeInDown" data-wow-delay="0.2s">Being from an engineering background I found out an universal law of creativity that</p>
			  	<p class="wow fadeInDown">“Creativity can neither be created nor can be destroyed,<br> It is simply transformed from generations to generation”</p>
				<p class="wow fadeInDown">That is the reason, we at Playhouse Media Works follow a rich tradition of offering practical & value-based service that is upheld since its founding.</p>
				<p class="wow fadeInDown">Since its inception in the year 2010, PMW has grown as an entity with a high value of commitment to provide an excellence, with abundance of creativity and with an extremely devoted creative team. We understand the importance of media engagement with business and society; we behave in a socially responsible manner and encourage our clients to do the same. We want our clients to have a satisfied, happy and enriching experience with us and to showcase themselves to the universe with the motivation and confidence to become responsible leaders who can make a significant contribution to the wealth and well-being of the societies in which they work.</p>
				<p class="wow fadeInDown">Never thought I would ever become a film-maker but I remember an instance when I was in 8th grade where I told my friend that I wanted to become a film-maker, maybe that moment just worked for me and after 14 years I got to direct my first feature film. Many of my friends and the people from my huge circle ask me that how did I transitioned from civil engineer to a film-maker to which I pass a pleasant smile and I narrate the story, which is my favorite hobby since childhood. I consider my timeline to be a reverse engineered one because I became an editor, then I became a director and surprisingly I became a scriptwriter later only because I always believed “never stop listening to your mind and soul”.</p>
				<p class="wow fadeInDown">With an intention to serve our clients with unique media solutions,  I am confident we can offer them an exceptional experience</p>
